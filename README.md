# jsecurity

Java-based security utilities for secure disk operations.

## ⚠️ WARNING - READ BEFORE USE ⚠️

**This utility performs DESTRUCTIVE operations that CANNOT be reversed.**

- Data overwritten by this tool is **PERMANENTLY LOST**
- There is **NO UNDO** functionality
- **Verify your target directories multiple times** before proceeding
- Designed for secure disposal of storage devices, not regular file deletion
- Always maintain backups of important data elsewhere

**Recommended use cases:**
- Wiping free space before selling/disposing of hardware
- Securely erasing decommissioned drives
- Preparing media for secure destruction

**NOT recommended for:**
- Regular file deletion (use `rm` or OS file manager instead)
- Active filesystems with important data
- System directories (tool blocks these, but be careful)

## Description

jsecurity is a disk wiping utility that securely overwrites free disk space with zero-filled files. It uses multiple worker threads to efficiently fill the target directory until the disk is full, making previously deleted data unrecoverable.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded operation** - Configurable worker threads for optimal performance
- **Configurable buffer sizes** - Adjust memory usage and write performance
- **Safety guards** - Prevents wiping of critical system directories
- **Confirmation prompts** - Requires explicit confirmation before destructive operations
- **Progress reporting** - Real-time feedback on operation progress
- **Flexible CLI** - Command-line options for automation and customization

## Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or higher** - Required to run the application
- **Maven 3.6+** - Required to build from source
- **Sufficient disk permissions** - Write access to target directories

## Building

Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This creates `target/jsecurity-1.0.jar` with all dependencies.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
java -jar target/jsecurity-1.0.jar <directory>
```

The tool will:
1. Display a warning about the destructive operation
2. Show the target directory and configuration
3. Prompt for confirmation (type `yes` to proceed)
4. Start worker threads to fill the disk
5. Report completion when disk is full

### Command-Line Options

```
Options:
  -t, --threads <count>      Number of worker threads (default: 4)
  -b, --buffer-size <bytes>  Buffer size in bytes (default: 10485760)
  -y, --yes                  Skip confirmation prompt (for automation)
  -h, --help                 Show help message
```

### Examples

**Wipe a single directory with defaults:**
```bash
java -jar target/jsecurity-1.0.jar /tmp/secure-wipe
```

**Use 8 threads with 20MB buffer:**
```bash
java -jar target/jsecurity-1.0.jar -t 8 -b 20971520 /tmp/secure-wipe
```

**Wipe multiple directories:**
```bash
java -jar target/jsecurity-1.0.jar /tmp/wipe1 /tmp/wipe2 /tmp/wipe3
```

**Skip confirmation (for scripts):**
```bash
java -jar target/jsecurity-1.0.jar -y /tmp/secure-wipe
```

## Safety Features

### Protected Directories

The tool automatically blocks operations on critical system directories:
- `/`, `/bin`, `/boot`, `/dev`, `/etc`, `/lib`, `/lib64`
- `/proc`, `/root`, `/sbin`, `/sys`, `/usr`, `/var`
- `/home`, `/Users`
- `C:\`, `C:\Windows`, `C:\Program Files` (Windows)

Attempting to wipe these directories will result in an error.

### Confirmation Prompt

Unless the `-y` flag is used, the tool displays:
- Target directories (absolute paths)
- Configuration (threads, buffer size)
- Warning about data loss
- Confirmation prompt requiring `yes` response

## How It Works

1. **Validation** - Checks target directories are safe and writable
2. **Configuration** - Parses command-line options and builds configuration
3. **Confirmation** - Prompts user to confirm (unless `-y` flag used)
4. **Thread Spawning** - Creates N worker threads (default: 4)
5. **File Creation** - Each thread creates temp files with pattern `wipe*.disk`
6. **Writing** - Each thread writes zero-filled buffers until disk is full
7. **Completion** - Reports when all threads have finished

The tool writes until it receives an `IOException` indicating the disk is full, then attempts a final write to fill any remaining space.

## Performance Tuning

### Thread Count (`-t`)

- **More threads** = faster fill on multi-core systems
- **Fewer threads** = lower CPU usage
- **Recommended**: Start with 4, increase if CPU is underutilized
- **Maximum**: Depends on system capabilities (8-16 is usually sufficient)

### Buffer Size (`-b`)

- **Larger buffers** = fewer system calls, potentially faster writes
- **Smaller buffers** = lower memory usage, more frequent progress updates
- **Default**: 10MB (10485760 bytes) is a good balance
- **Recommended range**: 1MB - 100MB depending on available RAM

## Security Considerations

- **This tool does NOT implement secure multi-pass wiping** (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M)
- It performs a **single-pass zero fill** of free space
- For highly sensitive data, consider:
  - Multiple passes with different patterns
  - Hardware-level secure erase (ATA Secure Erase, NVMe Sanitize)
  - Physical destruction of media
